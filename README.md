# flickr2blog

This is a little utility which I wrote to reduce the degree to which the archive of posts in my Wordpress-based blog was dependent on Flickr.

The basic idea is to find Flick URLs, download those photos, upload them to Wordpress and replace the URLs in the posts with ones that refer to the uploaded copies.

No documentation yet: read the code.  This is a work in progress.
